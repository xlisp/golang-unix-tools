## -----  docker io very slow , how to debug ? 

To debug a slow Docker `io` performance, you can follow these steps:

### 1. **Check Disk I/O Performance**
   - **Run `iotop` or `iostat`:** 
     These tools can help identify processes that are causing high disk I/O usage.
     ```bash
     sudo iotop
     ```
     or
     ```bash
     iostat -dx 1
     ```
     Look for high `await` and `svctm` times, which indicate disk bottlenecks.

### 2. **Inspect Docker Storage Driver**
   Docker's storage driver can significantly impact I/O performance.
   - **Check current storage driver:**
     ```bash
     docker info | grep "Storage Driver"
     ```
   - **Common drivers:**
     - **`overlay2`:** Generally recommended for modern Linux distributions.
     - **`aufs`:** Sometimes slower than `overlay2`.
   - **Switch storage drivers** if you're using a suboptimal driver like `aufs`:
     You might need to back up your data, stop Docker, modify `/etc/docker/daemon.json` to specify a different driver, and restart Docker.

### 3. **Inspect Container Configuration**
   - **Check resource limits:** 
     If containers have no `--io-weight`, they can cause uneven distribution of disk I/O.
     - Set limits like this:
       ```bash
       docker run --device-write-iops /dev/sda:1000 --device-read-iops /dev/sda:1000
       ```
   - **Adjust block IO (blkio):**
     You can set the `--blkio-weight` parameter to prioritize or limit disk access for containers:
     ```bash
     docker run --blkio-weight 500 ...
     ```

### 4. **Monitor Disk Usage**
   Check if you're running out of disk space or if thereâ€™s a high volume of temporary files inside containers.
   - **Inspect disk usage:**
     ```bash
     df -h
     ```
   - **Clean up unused data:**
     ```bash
     docker system prune
     ```

### 5. **Use SSDs or Optimize Storage**
   - If you're using spinning disks (HDD), consider switching to SSDs for better I/O performance.
   - For high I/O workloads, make sure Docker is running on the appropriate storage medium (fast SSDs or a networked storage system designed for high I/O).

### 6. **Inspect Docker Logs**
   - **Check Docker daemon logs:**
     ```bash
     journalctl -u docker.service
     ```
     This can give insights into any underlying issues.

### 7. **Use Direct I/O (`O_DIRECT`)**
   Containers that do a lot of random reads/writes may benefit from direct I/O. However, it can reduce the effectiveness of the OS page cache.

### 8. **Kernel Tuning**
   Sometimes, the default kernel I/O scheduler may not be optimal for your workload.
   - **Check I/O scheduler:**
     ```bash
     cat /sys/block/<device>/queue/scheduler
     ```
   - **Change scheduler (e.g., to `noop` or `deadline`):**
     ```bash
     echo noop | sudo tee /sys/block/<device>/queue/scheduler
     ```

### 9. **Monitor Network Latency (if using network storage)**
   If your containers rely on network storage (e.g., NFS, iSCSI), network latency could be a factor.
   - Use tools like `iftop` to monitor network usage.

### 10. **Upgrade Docker Version**
   Sometimes slow I/O performance is tied to specific Docker versions or bugs. Ensure that your Docker version is up to date.

By following these steps, you should be able to isolate and address the slow Docker I/O issues.
